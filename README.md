# Employee Credentialing Tracking
Web application to track employee credentials giving you alert colors and sending automated email to the specific employee.

# How it works
* The system is built 100% in PHP (some HTML, Javascript and JQuery knowledge is required).
* CSS used for the UI.
* There is 1 main page: index page shows the 3 functionalities available in the app such as active employees (shows a table with all employees), add a new employee and search employee by name, last name or date of birth. When you select an employee from the list of active employees you will see a table with the employee demographic and credentials. Also, you have the option to edit any employee info or delete it if needed.

# Requirements
